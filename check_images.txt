Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No. VGG and RESNET classified breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as "greyhound", while ALEXNET classified it as "whippet".


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No. VGG and RESNET classified breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg as "greyhound", and Dog_02.jpg as "whippet.
            ALEXNET classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as "whippet".


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: No. VGG identified Girl_02 as "hair spray," while its classifications for the other objects were somewhat accurate. 
        In contrast, both ResNet and AlexNet classified all objects mostly correctly.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: ResNet performed the best in classifying the four uploaded images. Although it couldn't classify Dog_02 as a "greyhound," it accurately identified the breed of Dog_01.
It also successfully classified the objects Coffee_mug_01 and Black_bear_01, and partially identified the object Girl_01 and Girl_02.
